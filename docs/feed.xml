It’s v0.14 of Dicey Dungeons! I know, it’s a saturday, and v0.13 was only two weeks ago, but after getting the final character up and running, I thought it was a good time to stop and polish up a few things. This build is mostly about polishing up some rough edges, and consolidating what we’ve got so far - but there’s some cool new stuff as well! Let’s have a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version14/finalecard.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Trading Posts, Booster Packs and Finale Cards&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying out a couple of new systems this time around, the biggest of which is the Trading Post. Trading Posts will offer to swap something you have for something else - usually something rare or unusual…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also made some improvements to the Jester, although it’s still in Alpha for this version. The Jester can now finds Booster Packs, which offer a combination of three cards, some good, some bad - take all of them or none of them. Also, I’ve introduced &lt;em&gt;Finale Cards&lt;/em&gt;! Finale Cards are powerful cards that only appear for the Jester if you use everything else in your hand in a single turn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also made dozens of little changes to all the characters, including changes to starting equipment and item distribution. Still planning a major design pass soon, but these improvements should help things a little until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version14/scathach.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;All enemies are animated!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of art edits in the this build! In particular, every enemy in the game is animated now! Ahhhh! And…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New combat music, new sound effects!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chipzel’s got an awesome new combat track for this version, but that’s not all - now that we’ve moved to desktop builds, we don’t have to worry so much about file size limits. So, this build includes all eight work in progress tracks that we’ve had over the last three versions, v0.11, v0.12 and v0.13!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these are rougher than others, of course - they’re all at an unfinished stage - but I think having all of them in the game really makes things come together! This version also has a bunch of new sound effects, and remasters of sounds from previous versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version14/soytari.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Turkish Translation&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One new translation this time around, Turkish! (random aside: Turkish has a cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/turkish-i18n.html&quot;&gt;string encoding&lt;/a&gt; tech challenge that was pretty fun to figure out!). Like Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Russian and Brazilian Portuguese, the Turkish translation is handled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/company/eds-wordland-ltd&quot;&gt;EDS Wordland&lt;/a&gt; and their international team of translators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a quicker than usual turn around on localisations this time, so I didn’t have time to get the newer Jester content translated yet. We’ll catch up for the next version!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.15?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game’s next milestone is the quest system, and we’ve been making some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marlowedobbe/status/1048659008196763648&quot;&gt;pretty exciting progress&lt;/a&gt; on that. Looking forward to sharing more of that once it’s ready.&lt;/p&gt;

This one’s a big one, so let’s jump right in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version13/jestergameplay.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;The Jester&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sixth and final character in Dicey Dungeons is &lt;em&gt;The Jester&lt;/em&gt;! I’ve known since the early weeks of development that I wanted to make a deckbuilding class for Dicey Dungeons, but it wasn’t until now that I had enough pieces in place to make it all happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Jester finds equipment, it gets added to a deck that you draw from randomly. You can have three pieces of equipment in play at any time, and you keep drawing until you can’t play any more cards. The key thing that makes this all work, though, is the &lt;em&gt;Snap!&lt;/em&gt; mechanic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Jester has matching pieces of equipment, you can &lt;em&gt;Snap!&lt;/em&gt; them and convert them into new dice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like how this character shaped up! I’m presenting it as an “alpha” in this version, mostly because I think there’s a lot more room to explore here, which I’m very excited to do over the next few versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version13/jesteranimate.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Animations and overworld sprites&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing animations! About half the enemies are currently animated, and the rest are coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the combat animations, we also have adorable new overworld sprites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Music and sound effects&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have new music and sound effects! This time around we reworked our sound tech a little to support different sound effects for different equipment. There’s also a new work in progress combat track!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version13/mods.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Modding API&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major development for people interested in modding: this version introduces a whole new modding API by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/larsiusprime&quot;&gt;Lars Doucet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, modding is kind of a three part problem - first, you need the infrastructure to support swapping in custom assets, then, you need to expose stuff from the game into files that can be modified, and thirdly, ideally, you need an editor that can modify those files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part one. Lars has implemented his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod&quot;&gt;polymod framework&lt;/a&gt; into Dicey Dungeons! It makes it possible to override and append Dicey Dungeon’s assets, and combine multiple mods together! It’s the start of something very cool, and I’m looking forward to seeing what people manage to do with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version13/translations.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;11 translations, and counting&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of Dicey Dungeons brings SIX new translations! The Spanish translation is by &lt;a href=&quot;http://nextlevellocalization.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Felipe Mercader&lt;/a&gt;, while Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Russian and Brazilian Portuguese are by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/company/eds-wordland-ltd&quot;&gt;EDS Wordland&lt;/a&gt; and their international team of translators!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’m still planning a couple more languages - Turkish, Japanese, Traditional Chinese and Irish, and then that’s probably it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Native Versions&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, v0.13 introduces native Windows, Mac and Linux versions of Dicey Dungeons! We are now abandoning HTML5 builds, which I think we’ve very much outgrown now. From here until we launch on steam, we’re going to be doing desktop builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new versions were made possible by our new programmer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jdbaudi&quot;&gt;Justo Delgado&lt;/a&gt;, who joined the Dicey Dungeons team a few weeks ago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.14?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jester is the final character - so, this marks a major milestone in the game. From here on out, my focus is going to be on tying everything together - which includes quest systems for repeated playthroughs, end game content, and in particular, lots of work to deepen and expand on what’s already in there. I see the six characters as they currently are as rough sketches - and I’m very, very excited to start filling out the details. I wanna make this game as great as I know it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This milestone does mean that the end is in sight, though, so recently I’ve been doing some serious thinking about when it’s actually going to be finished. I don’t think the late 2018 estimate is likely anymore, but I think we’re seriously looking at a launch early in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing, and I hope you enjoy the new character! See you in the next update!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Announcing v0.13 of Dicey Dungeons!

It’s version v0.12 of Dicey Dungeons! Let’s see what’s new!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version12/newwitch.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;All five characters are playable again&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Witch is back! The Robot too! And so is the editor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty unhappy about having to push this stuff back from v0.11, so I’m really, really glad to see em back in the game. The Witch, in particular, is still my favourite character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version12/robotvkraken.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Music&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chipzel’s been super busy over the last couple of weeks, and has two new tracks this time! A new combat track, and a new Boss theme! I’ve basically been listening to both on a loop now for last few weeks :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version12/greenforest.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Art&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlowe’s been busy too! This version has lots of new Art - new combat backgrounds for every location, coloured in character art to replace the previous sketches, and little improvements everywhere. (Marlowe also has a bunch of animations ready to go, but they’re not in the game &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version12/girlscout.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Enemies&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple of brand new enemies this time round, and some existing enemies (like Keymaster, Girl Scout and Crystalina) have had a complete redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version12/wordsofmagic.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Now in French&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dicey Dungeons is finally available in French, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wom_fr?lang=en&quot;&gt;Words of Magic&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.13?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still working on the final character, so that’s definitely the focus from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of my time over the last month or so programming, and I think that’s slowed things down a lot. So, I recently put out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2018/08/help-wanted-additional-programmer-for-dicey-dungeons/&quot;&gt;help wanted ad for a programmer&lt;/a&gt; to join the team. The idea is, they can focus on the big tech problems, and I can get back to focusing on design. Applications are open till Monday, so if you’re interested, check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing! See you in a few weeks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Surprise! It’s version v0.12 of Dicey Dungeons! Let’s see what’s new!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dicey Dungeons 0.11</title><link href="/blog/2018/08/05/version-11.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dicey Dungeons 0.11" /><published>2018-08-05T16:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-08-05T16:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/blog/2018/08/05/version-11</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2018/08/05/version-11.html">&lt;p&gt;Whoa, so this build’s really late! Sorry about that! But I’m really excited to finally be able to share it with everyone, at last!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I should say right away: this version has less content in it than v0.10 - unfortunately, the Robot and the Witch still need to be implemented in the new engine, and the editor currently isn’t working. All will be making a return soon in future versions, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new version is an absolutely huge overhaul of the entire game. Let’s have a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version11/overworld.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Art and Music&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of Dicey Dungeons finally introduces the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://marlowe.dobbe.com/&quot;&gt;Marlowe Dobbe&lt;/a&gt;, the game’s artist, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chipzel.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Chipzel&lt;/a&gt;, the game’s musician!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the design, the music and art in the game is a still a work in progress, and there are placeholders and unfinished pieces everywhere - but this represents a major step forward. I hope you like what our team has put together so far, and the direction we’re headed in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is wishful thinking, but I think getting the game to this point was the really hard bit. Now that we’re finally here, I think things will go &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version11/combat.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Sound Effects&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that’s new to this version: the game finally has sound effects! Yay! They’re also by Chipzel, who’s in charge of all things musical in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version11/newtranslations.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Now in Korean and German&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version has two new translations of the game - Korean, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://imbada.tistory.com/&quot;&gt;BADA IM&lt;/a&gt;, and German, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiegametranslations.com/&quot;&gt;Thomas Faust&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I should say that both translations are still in an alpha stage - unfortuantely I wasn’t able to get a playable build to either of them before this release, so they were unable to do things like check text widths or how things look in context. Still, like everything else, they should both get better and better as the game continues to develop!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.12?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a tough update. This probably won’t come as a surprise, but I’ve decided that it’s time to ditch the two week update schedule. It was great early in the project to keep up momentum - but now that we’re nearing the end, I feel like it’s doing more harm than good. Stressed out people don’t do their best work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’m switching to “regular” updates - which will still come out every couple of weeks or so - but without any advance warning! If you want to get notified of new versions, you can follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons&quot;&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh&quot;&gt;@terrycavanagh&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/z7pCdCP&quot;&gt;join the discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For v0.12, I’m excited to be getting back to design, and thinking about the final character. I’m also hoping to reintroduce the Robot and the Witch in our new engine. Thanks for playing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Whoa, so this build’s really late! Sorry about that!

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Dicey Dungeons Teaser&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please welcome the rest of team Dicey Dungeons! You can see a little preview of what they’ve been working on in this trailer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version10/artvart.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Art: Marlowe Dobbe&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dicey Dungeons new art director is Marlowe Dobbe! Marlowe is an amazing illustrator, animator, and game developer from Portland, Oregon. Her work ranges from animation for the D&amp;amp;D podcast Very Random Encounters, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://marlowe.dobbe.com/lost-wage-rampage&quot;&gt;Lost Wage Rampage&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marlowe.dobbe.com/walouija&quot;&gt;WAL-OUIJI board&lt;/a&gt;, which she describes as “a joke that went too far”. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/marlowedobbe/&quot;&gt;check out her instragram here&lt;/a&gt;, where she’ll be posting lots of work in progress Dicey Dungeons artwork over the next few weeks! (she’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marlowedobbe&quot;&gt;on twitter, here&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version10/chipzel.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Music: Chipzel&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on music, I’m very excited to announce that I’ve teamed up again with Niamh Houston, aka Chipzel! You might know her from her work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://superhexagon.com/&quot;&gt;Super Hexagon&lt;/a&gt; - but she’s also released three albums and worked on all sorts of cool projects, ranging from an Adventure Time game to a remix for Crypt of the NecroDancer. You can find her work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://chipzel.co.uk/&quot;&gt;http://chipzel.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chipzel/&quot;&gt;follow her on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where she’ll no doubt be sharing her work on Dicey Dungeons music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version10/banner.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;itch.io launch&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this version, &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons&quot;&gt;Dicey Dungeons is now on sale for $7.50 on itch.io&lt;/a&gt;! Itch is where I’ll be continuing to post regular alpha versions, every two weeks. The current version on itch.io is still using placeholder art and music, but I’m very excited to be finally implementing Marlowe and Niamh’s work over the past few weeks into the NEXT version!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you got in early enough on my discord (way back before v0.7), you’ll be getting a free itch.io code. More details about that on the discord! Oh, and the old alpha versions aren’t going anywhere, btw!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Character: The Robot&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this update, I added the game’s fifth character class, &lt;strong&gt;The Robot&lt;/strong&gt;! The robot falls somewhere between the Thief and the Inventor in terms of complexity - definitely easier than the Witch, but definitely harder than the Warrior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class is all about push your luck mechanics - instead of rolling dice every turn, you have a dice counter that ticks up everytime you &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to roll a dice. Doing well as the robot means knowing when to roll, and when to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I’m finding the robot super refreshing to play! I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Chinese Localisation&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indienova.com/corp/gutenberg/en&quot;&gt;IndieNova&lt;/a&gt; project, there is now a simplified chinese localisation of Dicey Dungeons v0.9 - and one for v0.10 will be coming in a few days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.11?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next update is really exciting for me, because that’s when I’m going to finally start implement Marlowe and Niamh’s work into the game! They’ve both been doing amazing work over the last few weeks, and I can wait to have it in the game and show it all to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing! See you in two weeks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Here we are! Version 0.10! The first commercial version! The game’s getting closer and closer to release! Let’s see what’s new.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dicey Dungeons 0.9</title><link href="/blog/2018/06/22/version-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dicey Dungeons 0.9" /><published>2018-06-22T03:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-06-22T03:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/blog/2018/06/22/version-9</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2018/06/22/version-9.html">&lt;p&gt;Hey! It’s version 0.9! We’re almost four months in now, gosh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new build is light on new features, but covers some very overdue balance and design changes that I think make the game a lot better. Let’s take a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version9/newspellbook.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Witch Redesigns&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of changes to the Witch class this time around. She finds more powerful, tempting spells now, and some of the existing powerful Witch spells like Fury and Meteor have been made much cheaper and more viable. Also, it’s now possible to prepare a spell in advance (or two, if you choose the level up perk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Witch is still the most complex class in the game, but I’m hoping these changes make her a little less scary to play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version9/iceage.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Enemy Design Pass&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve wanted to do for a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long time is a take a step back, and take a fresh look at all the enemies in the game, and how they could be better. So, I did a complete audit! (It’s very long, and full of spoilers, but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/raw/5AvMgfKa&quot;&gt;read it here if you like&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is major - virtually every enemy in the game has been tweaked. Six old enemies have been removed completely (including two bosses), and there are ten new ones. Also, some existing enemies, like Druid, have changed so much that they’re basically brand new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version9/cursed.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Status Effects&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from v0.8’s elemental magic pass, I did a bunch of work on the Status Effects this time around. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SILENCE:&lt;/strong&gt; Silence prevents you from using your class skills and limit breaks. The big change here is that it can now be broken, for the price of two dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CURSE:&lt;/strong&gt; The old curse effect used to set all your dice to 1, like a freeze all spell. I needed something new here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Curse causes your equipment to fail 50% of the time, forcing you to play carefully and think about what order you’re going to play your equipment in. (I liked how this worked out so much that I make a new guild based around it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCK:&lt;/strong&gt; The v0.7 and before times freeze behaviour, which prevented you from using a dice at all, has found a new home as Lock, which is appropriately super rare now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLIND:&lt;/strong&gt; This new status effect prevents you from seeing the values on your dice - though you can &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; still figure out what they are, depending on what you’ve got equipped…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also fixed a bunch of little things with the elemental attacks - you might find Ice attacks more effective now, for example, since many fewer enemies benefit from having reliable 1s. Shielding and Poison still need a closer look, but I’ll be diving into that for v0.10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version9/editor.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Editor Improvements&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I did more work on the editor! As well as some UI improvements, you can now create custom enemies, and try fighting against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to do a little work on the editor with every update from now on. I want it to be super easy and fun to make your own levels and mods, right from day 1!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version9/bugtracks.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Lots of bug fixes&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/diceydungeons.com/issues&quot;&gt;github issues tracker&lt;/a&gt;, I closed nearly 70 issues over the last two weeks! Still lots more bugs to fix, but the game’s way more stable now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.10?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next update is going to be a big one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one, v0.9 is the last free public build of the game - from v0.10 onwards, I will be &lt;strong&gt;SELLING ALPHA ACCESS&lt;/strong&gt; to the game on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/&quot;&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;. I’m also excited to finally introduce the rest of the team - both the game’s artist and musician have recently started working on the game, and I’m can’t wait to show you all what they’ve been up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing! See you in two weeks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Hey! It’s version 0.9!

Thanks for bearing with me with this delayed build - I’m very glad I took the extra week to do this new class properly! Let’s have a look at it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version8/witchmoves.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;The Witch&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So! The Witch! How do I describe the Witch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The witch is &lt;em&gt;complicated&lt;/em&gt;. Definitely not a class to pick for your first game. In the final version of the game, the Witch will probably be one of the last characters you unlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the witch is also &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike the other classes, the witch isn’t limited to whatever equipment she brings to the fight - the witch has four spell slots, which can be changed at any time. This means that you can, for example, cast four copies of a lockpick spell - and then use the dice you get from &lt;em&gt;THOSE&lt;/em&gt; spells to cast even more spells, which combine and so on and so on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the witch is a class for people who like building unstoppable machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very sure a lot of you are going to hate it, just like I’m very sure it’s going to be some people’s favourite class. I’m so happy with how it’s come together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version8/elements.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Elemental Magic&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time on this update working on deepening the elemental magic system in the game. A lot of these changes are pretty subtle, but they dramatically improve the range of interesting things that are possible! This is still a work in progress, but here are the big changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE:&lt;/strong&gt; All fire attacks now also inflict a &lt;strong&gt;BURN&lt;/strong&gt; status effect. Burn causes your dice to catch fire - you can still use them, but you’ll take some damage if you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Ice has been majorly nerfed in v0.8! The &lt;strong&gt;FROZEN&lt;/strong&gt; status effect no longer locks up a dice, but instead changes its value to 1. For some classes, this is devastating - for others, not really a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIGHTNING:&lt;/strong&gt; The old stun behaviour has basically just been renamed Lightning. &lt;strong&gt;SHOCKING&lt;/strong&gt; an enemy with a lightning spell causes a piece of equipment to lock up! (you can drop a dice on it to release it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EARTH:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, Earth damage, which I’m really happy about - attacking with earth causes a &lt;strong&gt;WEAKEN&lt;/strong&gt; status effect, which downgrades equipment. There’s actually a whole separate downgrade variation for every single piece of equipment in the game now, just like the upgrade variations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, while I was at it, I scrapped the concept of poison and elemental immunity from the game, and instead replaced it with resistances, which I think are a lot more interesting. (This should mean that, for example, bringing a fire build against a Dragon isn’t hopeless anymore!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version8/7drl.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Team Dicey Dungeons&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2018/05/help-wanted-art-director-for-dicey-dungeons/&quot;&gt;(on my blog)&lt;/a&gt;, that I put up an ad for an Art Director for the game! I got a lot of submissions, and it’s a very tough decision - but I hope to have some news about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahhhhhh, look at that 7drl screenshot! This game has come such a long way :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.9?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making new content is really fun, but it’s probably about time I slowed down and started fixing some broken stuff. There are over &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/diceydungeons.com/issues&quot;&gt;100 open issues on the bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;, including a few crash bugs, so for v0.9 I wanna tackle as many of them as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a good reason for that too. &lt;em&gt;v0.9 will be the LAST free public build of the game&lt;/em&gt; - so I want it to be polished, and stable! I’ll be continuing with this whole open development thing after that, but from behind a paywall (on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/&quot;&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;!). I’ll have more information about that next update!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing! See you in another two weeks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">At long last, version 0.8!

Version 0.7! Let’s see what’s new this time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version7/newmap.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Totally Redesigned Dungeon Exploration&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this version, I’ve completely redesigned the exploration phase of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new maps are less than a 5th of the size of the old ones. It’s less complicated, it requires less clicking, and, I think, suits the game much better than the old system. It boils this phase down to pure decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, other game elements have been simplified too - all the gold values have been reworked (You get exactly one gold per battle now, and equipment tends to cost between 2-5 gold), and experience points match the enemies you’re fighting (a level 2 enemy gives you 2 experience points) - making the game much more boardgamey, and much easier to make strategic decisions about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a bunch of other little structural things - for example, I’ve spread the dungeon out over 5 floors instead of 3 (although it’s actually shorter now thanks to the smaller levels), and it’s all been redesigned so that you don’t need to fight every monster to finish a Dungeon. As a result of all of this, I think the stuff &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of combat is pretty substantially improved in this version!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version7/guild.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Guilds&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best new thing in this update: Guilds! Guilds are my take on roguelike shrine mechanics - they don’t appear everytime you play, but when they do, they’ll offer you some strange wonderful new power… for a price. There a four in the game right now, and I’ll be adding more with each update!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably end up reframing guilds in a later version (possibly as something curse themed), but what I’m aiming for is this mechanic where you can take on this extra, bonus challenge for fun. Guilds are always a big risk, but if you go for them, they change up the way you play the game, and open up new kinds of weirder playstyles you can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version7/editor.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Editor Mode&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve implemented a first draft of an in game editor! The current version lets you arm a player with any equipment from the game you want, and fight any of the enemies in the game. Eventually, this mode will let you create full mods and challenges for the game. (It’s already seeing some very cool stuff happen on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/z7pCdCP&quot;&gt;Dicecord&lt;/a&gt; with people trying to make one turn infinite dice builds!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Decisions&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the v0.6 post, I mentioned wanting to catch my breath, and figure out where this whole thing is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ve done that. I’ve made some big decisions! Expect a blog post in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So what about v0.8?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next update, I’m going to introduce another new class, the &lt;em&gt;Mage&lt;/em&gt;. This class will require a little firming up of some basic combat mechanics, so I’ll probably end up doing quite a lot of work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing! See you in another two weeks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s here! Version 0.7!

It’s v0.6! I’d sorta planned that this one would be a smaller update, since I was travelling for a bit of it. But it ended up being HUGE. Let’s jump in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version6/characters.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Character: The Inventor&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured it was time I tried out some weirder character ideas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Inventor&lt;/em&gt; is a new class focused on abilities that you get for one fight only, called gadgets. (Gadgets replace items.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inventor is a class with some pretty big pros and cons - on the plus side, they get gadgets, which are super powerful, and they find some of the most powerful equipment in the game just lying around. However! The Inventor’s compulsive need to tinker with things results it in scrapping most of your equipment for parts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing the Inventor well requires thinking ahead and planning what you think you’ll need, and what you think you can do without. I hope you enjoy it! Like everything in the game, it’s a work in progress, and should improve as time goes by!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version6/snowman.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New Warrior&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pretty major changes to the Warrior this time - they’ve lost the ability to use items, which are now redesigned as “gadgets”, and are unique to the new Inventor class. However, to compensate, they get a new dice tweak ability to go with their reroll skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want Warrior to be the introductory class, so the changes I’ve made &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; make it easier. As well as the skill change, they also find more powerful equipment, and there are a load of tweaks to add variety to the range of viable builds you can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The thief has also had a few tweaks, but they’re a lot less dramatic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version6/rogue.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New enemies, and new Enemy AI&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent almost a week of this fortnight on Enemy AI - it’s had a complete rewrite! Enemies can handle much more complicated situations now, allowing them to do new things like use reusable equipment, and make decisions about dice to set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s enabled me to make a couple of more sophisticated enemies to match, so this build introduces &lt;strong&gt;five new enemies&lt;/strong&gt;, and a new &lt;strong&gt;final boss&lt;/strong&gt;, the Crime Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version6/limitbreak.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Limit Breaks&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New mechanic I’m trying out: Limit Breaks! Each character has a special skill that they can use once they’ve taken enough damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;What's the plan for v0.7?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m long overdue a polish update, so for v0.7 I’m planning to slow down a little, and do some work on balance, polish and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are going pretty well! I think it’s time I made some decisions about where this is all going!&lt;/p&gt;

Whoa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome! If you’re dropping by for the first time, here’s what’s going on: &lt;em&gt;Dicey Dungeons&lt;/em&gt; is a game I started making for this year’s 7 day roguelike. It’s now a month and a half on, I’m still working on it, and it’s going very well! The game’s basically a roguelike inspired by Dream Quest and games like that - only it’s designed around dice instead of cards. You explore a dungeon, you find equipment, and you use dice on that equipment to activate it. I think it’s already pretty fun, and it’s getting better with every update!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m releasing new work in progress builds every two weeks. Here’s what I’ve been working on since the last update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version5/apprentice.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;I finally made some graphics&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a long time coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to a two week schedule gives me more freedom to work on larger stuff for the game. This week, I used that extra time to finally add some graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still a bit rough in places, but I should be able to iterate on this stuff now and improve it as the weeks go by and LOOK LOOK, the little dice people have stubby little legs and big smiles! Aren’t they’re cute? Awwww&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version5/thiefvswolfpuppy.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Equipment fires without needing a confirmation&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two very radical changes to how equipment works this week: you need to fill all dice slots on a piece of equipment to use it, and equipment fires automatically once all the slots are full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a tiny change, but it has a pretty massive knock on effect to lots of things in the game. And I think it’s worth it! For me, the game just feels &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; nicer to play with this change - I can’t go back to the old v0.4 way at all after this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular this makes the Thief class a lot nicer to play - way less finicky mouse movement to trigger reusable equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version5/upgrades.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;New upgrade system&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old upgrade system was designed around the Warrior, but the new equipment UI rules broke it completely. So, I tried something new!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new upgrade system is inspired by fellow dreamquestlike &lt;strong&gt;Slay the Spire&lt;/strong&gt; - every piece of equipment in the game can now be upgraded, and the effect of upgrading is unique to each piece of equipment. Upgrading the &lt;em&gt;Dagger&lt;/em&gt; gives it bonus +1 damage, for example, while upgrading the &lt;em&gt;Poison Needle&lt;/em&gt; lets it accept a broader range of dice, making it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version5/hardmode.gif&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Hard Mode&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;v0.5 has a new HARD MODE! In this version, all enemy equipment is upgraded, and enemies get an extra 20% health. If you’ve been around since the start and find the game a bit easy now, this should provide a more interesting challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/version5/optimised.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;&quot;&gt;Optimisation&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dicey Dungeons was hacked together for a game jam, and that meant that it was running quite a lot slower than it should have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a big optimisation pass this week that should substantially improve things - in my profiler tests, I was getting frame time reductions of up to 500%, depending on what was happening in the game at the time. There’s more I can do about this later, but these optimisations should leave the game a lot more stable and lightweight from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;What's the plan for v0.6?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I’m off to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amaze-berlin.de/&quot;&gt;AMAZE&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin, so I’m expecting a slightly smaller than normal update. To be honest, this feels like a good time to catch my breath, and figure out where this whole thing is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I’d really like to get to work on a new class for the next update - I think the Thief is working really well, and I eventually see there being 5 or 6 classes in the final version. Let’s see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s version 0.5! Whoa!</summary></entry></feed>
