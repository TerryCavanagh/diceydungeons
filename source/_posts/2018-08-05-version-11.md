Whoa, so this build's really late! Sorry about that! But I'm really excited to finally be able to share it with everyone, at last!

One thing I should say right away: this version has less content in it than v0.10 - unfortunately, the Robot and the Witch still need to be implemented in the new engine, and the editor currently isn't working. All will be making a return soon in future versions, though.

This new version is an absolutely huge overhaul of the entire game. Let's have a look!

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;">New Art and Music</div>

This version of Dicey Dungeons finally introduces the work of <a href="http://marlowe.dobbe.com/">Marlowe Dobbe</a>, the game's artist, and <a href="https://chipzel.co.uk/">Chipzel</a>, the game's musician!

Like the design, the music and art in the game is a still a work in progress, and there are placeholders and unfinished pieces everywhere - but this represents a major step forward. I hope you like what our team has put together so far, and the direction we're headed in!

Maybe this is wishful thinking, but I think getting the game to this point was the really hard bit. Now that we're finally here, I think things will go *much* smoother.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;">Sound Effects</div>

Another thing that's new to this version: the game finally has sound effects! Yay! They're also by Chipzel, who's in charge of all things musical in the game.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;">Now in Korean and German</div>

This version has two new translations of the game - Korean, by <a href="http://imbada.tistory.com/">BADA IM</a>, and German, by <a href="https://indiegametranslations.com/">Thomas Faust</a>!

(I should say that both translations are still in an alpha stage - unfortuantely I wasn't able to get a playable build to either of them before this release, so they were unable to do things like check text widths or how things look in context. Still, like everything else, they should both get better and better as the game continues to develop!)

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">So what about v0.12?</div>

This was a tough update. This probably won't come as a surprise, but I've decided that it's time to ditch the two week update schedule. It was great early in the project to keep up momentum - but now that we're nearing the end, I feel like it's doing more harm than good. Stressed out people don't do their best work!

Instead, I'm switching to "regular" updates - which will still come out every couple of weeks or so - but without any advance warning! If you want to get notified of new versions, you can follow me on <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons">itch.io</a>, twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh">@terrycavanagh</a>, or <a href="https://discord.gg/z7pCdCP">join the discord</a>.

For v0.12, I'm excited to be getting back to design, and thinking about the final character. I'm also hoping to reintroduce the Robot and the Witch in our new engine. Thanks for playing!
