Hi modders! I've decided to make the source code of a few core classes available as reference.

These were uploaded on the 19th July, before v1.9, so they might be a little out of date (or ahead of date!) depending on when you read them.

Just so there's no confusion here: The purpose of making these source code extracts available is as reference for Dicey Dungeons modders only, and is not intended as "open sourcing" the game for public contributions. I am not interested in any code contributions (particularly regarding code style)! Any suggested changes that lead to me making changes or fixing bugs in Dicey Dungeons are considered a donation, and do not come with any compensation of any kind!
